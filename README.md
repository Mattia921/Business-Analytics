Urban Mobility Conjoint Analysis

Urban mobility has become a crucial aspect in the recent years and this was probably caused by: always more populated cities; the increasing pollution in city centers; the request for flexible means of transport. These arising necessities have not been faced with appropriate solutions by municipals administrations. For this reason, we thought that it could be interesting to collect insights about a possible unique urban mobility subscription, which includes different means of transport and might meet the demand for flexibility as well as greater sustainability. Trying to assess this, we structured a questionnaire to be analyzed using Choice-based Conjoint Analysis. In particular the project is structured as follows:
* Multinomial Logit Model (MNL);
* Multilevel Multinomial Logit Model (Mixed MNL);
* Willingness-to-Pay and Preference Shares;
* Detection and explanation of possible market niches through the collected individual-level variables.
